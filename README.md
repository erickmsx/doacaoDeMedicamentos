# DoaÃ§Ã£o de Medicamentos

## The App ðŸ’¡

A simple Android App of hospitals medicines donation.

With the pacients leftover medicines from the hospital where my girlfriend works
came the idea of creating an App where people can receive this medicines donation 
from the pacients who don't need this medications anymore. 

## The App has two access types! One for the hospital and other for people who need donation. 

#### What each type can do:

## For the hospital:

* Login with previous setted email and password administrator 
* Register new medicines donation
* See the list of people requests donation

## For the common user:

* People who need the donation can register in the app
* Login with email and password
* See the medicine donations list avaliable
* Send to the hospital a request donation of a medicine that are avaliable in the previous list

## Resources
* The App was made in Android Studio supported for Java
* The authentication and user data register were made utilizing <a href="https://firebase.google.com//">Firebase</a>
* For listing the medicine and requests was utilized RecyclerView
* All project based in object oriented programming
